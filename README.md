This is my Makmal FHY1 - PC Usage Log Form Website created for users to submit a PC Usage Log Form using an online method by integrating Github.io and Google Form.

In this website, there is no database usage. Only a static website using bootstrap layout embedded with Google Form. The students need to fill-in their necessary information when using the PC at the laboratory after chosen their PC number by clicking at the PC Number menu.

To compile and use this system. Please follow steps as below:

Install xampp in your Window or Linux. Or install Laragon in your Window. Put this project into your working directory folder.

That's all. Happy learning! Feel free to view the website at https://fhy1Lab.github.io

If you did find any bug in this system or if you have updated and upgraded the module in this system, feel free to share it with me and to pull request from my repository. Your contribution is highly appreciated.
